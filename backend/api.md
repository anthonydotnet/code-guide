# APIs
- Should return well structured objects
- Avoid returning HTML

# Structure
- REST is helpful, however bad REST can sometimes result in an ugly API which is hard to use
-- eg. /search/people/null/null/manager/null/
- Leverage query strings where appropriate
-- eg. /search/people/?jobTitle=manager

## API Response Models
- Avoid using the same model for API responses & MVC views
