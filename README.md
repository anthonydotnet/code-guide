# code-guide
This respository of documentation is a high level set of guidelines for software engineering/development. The purpose is to gather commonly used good/best practices in a single place, so that developers (new and old) can see what other devs consider to be good code.

The guidelines here are not meant to be dogmatic, and are expected to change/evolve over time.

Pull-requests are welcome!
